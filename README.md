# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It is designed to help developers quickly bootstrap a React application using Vite as the build tool, enabling fast development and efficient production builds.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a streamlined environment for developing React applications with modern tooling. By using Vite, developers benefit from features like hot module replacement (HMR) for a better development experience and optimized builds for production.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
